# Shout

A simple boiler plate I designed to jump start my personal applications.

Built off of create-react-app, it adds the following libraries:

* React-Router
* Redux
* Redux Thunk
* Redux-Logger
* Redux-Persist
* Redux-Form
* Redux-Devtools-Extension
* Reselect
* Axios
* PropTypes
* Bootstrap 4
* Styled Components
